WINTER-SPECIFIC TESTING REPORT
Energy Poverty Detection Using Smart Meter Data
======================================================================

OBJECTIVE 5: Test models specifically on winter data when energy poverty
             is most severe and health risks are greatest.

======================================================================
1. WINTER DATA SUMMARY
======================================================================

Analysis Period: December, January, February
Total Households: 5,547
Energy-Poor Households: 1,090 (19.65%)

3. KEY FINDINGS
======================================================================

⭐ BEST MODEL FOR WINTER: XGBoost
   Winter Recall: 0.9992
   Detects 99.9% of energy-poor households in winter

CRITICAL INSIGHT:
Winter performance is the TRUE test of model utility, as this is when:
- Energy poverty has the most severe health impacts
- Vulnerable households need immediate support
- Early intervention can prevent crisis situations

======================================================================
4. POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS
======================================================================

1. Deploy XGBoost for winter monitoring
2. Increase monitoring frequency during winter months (Dec-Feb)
3. Pre-emptive outreach before winter begins
4. Focus on evening/night consumption patterns (heating indicators)
5. Immediate welfare checks for self-disconnection events

======================================================================
OBJECTIVE 5 STATUS: COMPLETE ✓
======================================================================

Winter testing confirms model performance during the critical period
when energy poverty has the most severe consequences for vulnerable
households.
