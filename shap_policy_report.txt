5. q75_consumption                          (Importance: 0.0282)


======================================================================
2. ACTIONABLE POLICY INSIGHTS
======================================================================

Based on SHAP analysis, the following patterns are strongest indicators
of energy poverty:

✓ MONITORING PRIORITIES:
  - Focus automated monitoring systems on the top 5 features above
  - These patterns should trigger immediate welfare checks
  
✓ INTERVENTION THRESHOLDS:
  - Alert when households exceed vulnerability thresholds
  - See policy_thresholds.csv for specific values
  
✓ TARGETED SUPPORT:
  - Households showing multiple vulnerability indicators need priority support
  - Early intervention before crisis point is critical

======================================================================
3. NEXT STEPS FOR POLICYMAKERS
======================================================================

1. Implement automated monitoring for top vulnerability indicators
2. Set up alert system using recommended thresholds
3. Develop intervention protocols for flagged households
4. Monitor effectiveness and refine thresholds over time
5. Conduct pilot program in high-risk areas
